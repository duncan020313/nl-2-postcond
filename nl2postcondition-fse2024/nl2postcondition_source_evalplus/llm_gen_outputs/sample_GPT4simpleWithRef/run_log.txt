 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for has_close_elements, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:

from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """


    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        if sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for has_close_elements. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, has_close_elements) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function has_close_elements executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for mean_absolute_deviation, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:

from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """

    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for mean_absolute_deviation. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, mean_absolute_deviation) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function mean_absolute_deviation executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sum_product, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:

from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """

    s, p = 0, 1
    for number in numbers:
        s += number
        p *= number
    return s, p



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sum_product. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sum_product) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function sum_product executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for longest, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:

from typing import List, Optional


def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    >>> longest([])

    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """

    if not strings:
        return None

    maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)
    for s in strings:
        if len(s) == maxlen:
            return s



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for longest. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, longest) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function longest executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for count_distinct_characters, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')

    return len(set(string.lower()))



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for count_distinct_characters. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, count_distinct_characters) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for find_closest_elements, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:

    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            min_pair = (l, r)
    return min_pair



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for find_closest_elements. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, find_closest_elements) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function find_closest_elements executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for largest_divisor, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """


    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0: return n // i
    return 1



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for largest_divisor. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, largest_divisor) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function largest_divisor executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for concatenate. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, concatenate) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function concatenate executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function find_zero executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sort_third, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def sort_third(l: list):

    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal

    third.sort()
    return [third[i // 3] if i % 3 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))]



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sort_third. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sort_third) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sort_even, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """

    even = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    even.sort()
    return [even[i // 2] if i % 2 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))]



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sort_even. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sort_even) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function sort_even executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for triples_sum_to_zero. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, triples_sum_to_zero) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function triples_sum_to_zero executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for change_base. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, change_base) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function change_base executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for modp, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """


    res, x = 1, 2
    while n != 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            res = res * x % p
        x = x * x % p
        n //= 2
    return res % p



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for modp. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, modp) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function modp executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, add) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function add executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for common, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    """

    return sorted(list(set(l1).intersection(set(l2))))



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for common. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, common) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function common executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for derivative, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:



def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """


    return [xs[i] * i for i in range(1, len(xs))]



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for derivative. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, derivative) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function derivative executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for digitSum, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def digitSum(s):
    """Task
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'
    ASCII codes.

    Examples:
        digitSum("") => 0
        digitSum("abAB") => 131
        digitSum("abcCd") => 67
        digitSum("helloE") => 69
        digitSum("woArBld") => 131
        digitSum("aAaaaXa") => 153
    """

    return sum([ord(ch) for ch in s if ch.isupper()])



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for digitSum. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, digitSum) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function digitSum executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for search. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, search) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for smallest_change, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr_reversed[i]:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for smallest_change. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, smallest_change) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function smallest_change executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for iscube, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    iscube(1) ==> True
    iscube(2) ==> False
    iscube(-1) ==> True
    iscube(64) ==> True
    iscube(0) ==> True
    iscube(180) ==> False
    '''

    a = abs(a)
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for iscube. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, iscube) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function iscube executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, is_happy) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function is_happy executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for solve, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """


    s = sum(map(lambda x: int(x), str(N)))
    return bin(s)[2:]



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for solve. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, solve) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function solve executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

ðŸª…  Generating 10 responses for the following prompt: 
 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sort_array, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """


    if array == []: return []
    return sorted(array, reverse=(array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0)



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sort_array. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sort_array) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function sort_array executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for is_bored. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

            break
        if not k.islower(): lower = False
        if not k.isupper(): upper = False
    return lower or upper



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for check_dict_case. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, check_dict_case) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function check_dict_case executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for closest_integer, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    '''


    def rounding(val):
        if abs(val - int(val)) != 0.5:
            return round(val)
        if val > 0:
            return int(val) + 1
        else:
            return int(val) - 1
    return rounding(float(value))



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for closest_integer. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, closest_integer) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function closest_integer executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for rounded_avg, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """


    if n > m: return -1
    avg = round((n + m) / 2)
    return bin(avg)



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for rounded_avg. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, rounded_avg) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function rounded_avg executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:

        else:
            ans.append(ans[-2] * (i - 1) * i)
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for f. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, f) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function f executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for exchange, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """


    cnt_odd = len(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1, lst1)))
    cnt_even = len(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst2)))
    return "YES" if cnt_odd <= cnt_even else "NO"



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for exchange. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, exchange) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function exchange executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for odd_count, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """


    ans, template = [], "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
    for s in lst:
        odd_cnt = len(list(filter(lambda ch: int(ch) % 2 == 1, s)))
        ans.append(template.replace("i", str(odd_cnt)))
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for odd_count. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, odd_count) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function odd_count executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for select_words, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """


    ans = []
    for word in s.split(" "):
        if word != "":
            c_cnt = len(list(filter(lambda ch: ch not in "aeiouAEIOU", word)))
            if c_cnt == n: ans.append(word)
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for select_words. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, select_words) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function select_words executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for maximum, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    Example 1:

        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
        Output: [-4, -3, 5]

    Example 2:

        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
        Output: [4, 4]

    Example 3:

        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
        Output: [2]

    Note:
        1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
        2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
        3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)
    """


    return sorted(sorted(arr)[::-1][:k])



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for maximum. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, maximum) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function maximum executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function get_odd_collatz executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for valid_date, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def valid_date(date):
    """You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

    for example: 
    valid_date('03-11-2000') => True

    valid_date('15-01-2012') => False

    valid_date('04-0-2040') => False

    if not 1 <= m <= 12: return False

    return True



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for valid_date. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, valid_date) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for intersection, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """


    def is_prime(a):
        return not (a < 2 or any(a % x == 0 for x in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1)))
    if interval1[0] > interval2[0]: interval1, interval2 = interval2, interval1
    l, r = interval2[0], min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    return "YES" if is_prime(r - l) else "NO"



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for intersection. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, intersection) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function intersection executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for minPath, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def minPath(grid, k):

    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

        else:
            ans.append(ans[-1] + ans[-2] + 1 + (i + 1) / 2)
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for tri. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, tri) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function tri executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for check_if_last_char_is_a_letter. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, check_if_last_char_is_a_letter) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for is_equal_to_sum_even, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers

    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """

    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for is_equal_to_sum_even. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, is_equal_to_sum_even) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function is_equal_to_sum_even executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sum_squares, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:




def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """

    ans = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            ans += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0:
            ans += num ** 3
        else:
            ans += num
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sum_squares. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sum_squares) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function sum_squares executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks
CODE FOR EXACTLY ONE POSTCONDITION USING ASSERT GOES HERE
``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function order_by_points executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for specialFilter, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def specialFilter(nums):

    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2

        if num > 10 and str(num)[0] in odd and str(num)[-1] in odd:
            ans += 1
    return ans



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for specialFilter. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, specialFilter) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for sorted_list_sum, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
    """

    from functools import cmp_to_key

        return -1 if s < t else 1
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda s: len(s) % 2 == 0, lst)), key=cmp_to_key(cmp))



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for sorted_list_sum. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, sorted_list_sum) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function sorted_list_sum executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

################### ONE ANSWER for HumanEval/152, postcondition ###################
```python
# This postcondition checks if the length of the return value is equal to the length of the input lists. 
# This ensures that for every element in the input lists, there is a corresponding value in the output.
assert len(return_value) == len(game) == len(guess), "Output length does not match input length"
```
This postcondition asserts that the length of the return value (the result of the `compare` function) is equal to the length of the input lists `game` and `guess`. According to the function's docstring, the length of the return value should be equal to the length of the input lists. Therefore, this postcondition checks an essential aspect of the function's correctness. It ensures that for every element in the input lists, there is a corresponding value in the output.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for Strongest_Extension, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """


    def strength(s: str) -> int:
        CAP, SM = 0, 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch.isupper(): CAP += 1
            if ch.islower(): SM += 1
        return CAP - SM
    max_strength = max(map(strength, extensions))
    for e in extensions:
        if strength(e) == max_strength:
            return class_name + "." + e



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for Strongest_Extension. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, Strongest_Extension) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```
# Comment explaining what aspect of the function the symbolic postcondition checks

``` 

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function Strongest_Extension executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.

 You are provided with the following Python function implementation for right_angle_triangle, and you want to ensure it is implemented correctly according to the specification in the docstring:


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''

    
    return a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2 or a ** 2 + c ** 2 == b ** 2 or b ** 2 + c ** 2 == a ** 2



Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for right_angle_triangle. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, right_angle_triangle) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for do_algebra. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, do_algebra) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

Although the postcondition should be less computationally complex than the function itself and relatively simple, it should not be trivial. It should encapsulate an aspect of the function output specification without implementing the function itself and should be easily readable by a human.

While not trivial, your postcondition should still be very simple and short. It should be a single line of code that is not too long, and it should capture only one aspect of the function's behavior, not all of it. For example, if the goal of the function were to sort a list, you might write a postcondition that checks that the elements in the list are in sorted order, or you might write a postcondition that checks that the list is the same length as the input list. You would not write a postcondition that checks both of these things.

The format of your response should be:
```

The postcondition should hold true whenever the function do_algebra executes successfully as specified in the docstring, regardless of its internal implementation.
